# Tech-Forum

**Version 1.0.0**

## Description
The purpose of this project was to create a full stack application leveraging MVC organizational architecture. More specifically this application was designed to be a tech forum where developers could write blog posts, and interact with an online community about technical matters.

### Significant Changes
Models were built for developers, blog posts, and comments. I was able to utilize this to create the various table associations. From there routes were established to not only fetch data from the database, but also non-api routes were used to render the handlebars.

### Challenges
The biggest challenge was managing all aspects of the development process, and making sure everything was cohesive and working properly, so the user experience was sufficient. I noticed fetch requests to the various routes were syntaxically sensitive. I would get fetch errors for some minor oversights.
